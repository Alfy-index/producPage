        <h2>Free Range Chicken </h2>
        <p>The richest man in the world and Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, regards Chicken business
          venture as a lucrative business. He is giving out hundreds of thousands of chickens as a means
          of empowering people to earn an income by starting chicken farming businesses. In his article
          on his website, “Why I would raise Chickens,” Bill Gates states that Chickens are a good venture
          which can make a lot of revenue for the people as they have a multiplicative effect, due to the
          fact that they lay and hatch eggs frequently, thus multiplying the size of your flock.</p>
